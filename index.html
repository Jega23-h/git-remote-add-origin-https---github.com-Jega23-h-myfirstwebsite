                            <p class="highlight">Like you, basketball wasn't just a game for me – it was everything.</p>
                            
                            <p>Every morning before sunrise, you'd find me on the court. The rhythmic bounce of the ball, the squeak of shoes, and countless hours of drills shaped not just my game, but my character. High school basketball taught me discipline, but what I discovered after graduation changed everything.</p>
                            
                            <p>While my peers saw the end of high school basketball as a finale, I saw it as a beginning. I realized that the same drive that pushed me to perfect my jump shot could transform every aspect of life. The discipline of an athlete became my foundation for personal growth.</p>
                            
                            <p>Today, I'm here to show you that your athletic mindset is your greatest asset. The habits, mental toughness, and resilience you're building on the court? They're the exact tools you need for lifelong success.</p>
                            
                            <p class="closing-statement">Your basketball journey is preparing you for something bigger than the game. Let's unlock that potential together.</p>
